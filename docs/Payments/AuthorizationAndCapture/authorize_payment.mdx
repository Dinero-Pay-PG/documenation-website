# Authorize a payment

In order to authorize a payment , you will use the same <u>[`POST /purchases/`](../../../api/gateway/purchases-create)</u> however this time you will set the `skip_capture` parameter to `true` <br></br>

## Preauthorization
This flag can also enable preauthorization capability , allowing you to [save the card](../saving-card/save_card) without a financial transaction.

:::caution

Preauthorization depand on the provider so it might not work <br></br> and require you to use it with a financial transaction

:::

If the customer agrees to store his card for future purchases,<br></br>
You can recharge him later using the saved card <br></br>

:::note
Due to the regulation here in Saudi Arabia customer need to be present to enter his <u>CVV</u>
