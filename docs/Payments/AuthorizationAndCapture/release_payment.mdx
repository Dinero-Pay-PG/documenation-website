you will get a response with status code `200` and a Purchase object having `status = pending_release` <br></br>
also you will be notified in webhook , you will get `purchase.pending_release` event if you suscripe to <u>purchase.released</u> event

## Sample request 
```json
{
    
}
```
> Nothing passed in the body for this operation
>
> You will pass the id from the `authorization` part as a path parameter

If fund release fails due to payment processing error, you will receive HTTP response code `400` with error code `purchase_release_error`<br></br>
In this case, to get more details about the error, you should perform a [`GET /purchase/`](../.../../api/gateway/purchases-read) request for the Purchase you tried to release funds for <br></br>
`transaction_data.attempts[]` array (newest element first) you'll find the corresponding attempt with error code and description in `.error` parameter
