## Overview
Billing is to request a payment from customers by issuing invoices<br></br>
To send one-off invoices, use <u>[`POST /billing/`](../../../api/gateway/billing-templates-one-time-invoices)</u> request<br></br>
It's similar to `POST /purchases/` except that _customers are an array_, allowing you to bulk-issue invoices to several customers at once.

---
## Requirement
> Note that in ordet to send an invoice you will have to create a <u>[client](../client)</u> as it's a mandatory field

## Billing template
To save you time you can create a `billing_templates` to use it for multiple `billing` request<br></br>
By creating a `billing_templetes` no need to create specify the `billing` details in the request <br></br>
This will help you if you are issuing the same invoice for multiple customers
