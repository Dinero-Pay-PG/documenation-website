## Custome integration

Direct post integration allows running payments through the custom payment flow <br></br>

To capture customers card details use an HTML `<form>` hosted on your website with `method="POST"` and action _pointing to the `direct_post_url` of the transaction_ <br></br>

## How to make a request 

> 1. From your server side make a `POST` reqeust to `https://gate.dineropay.com/api/v1/purchases/`
> 2. In the response you will receive the `direct_post_url`
> 3. From you client_side capture your cutomer card details
> 4. Send a request to the `direct_post_url` with the `<form>` data

## Capture Form inputs data

To leverage `Direct Post` checkout you will need `<form>` having `method="POST"` and `action="<direct_post_url>"` <br></br>
In your `<form>` include the following _inputs_


| Input name  | Input type  | Value                                                                                        |
| ----------- | ----------- | -----------
| cardholder_name | Text       | Latin letters only space and apostrophe ('), dot (.), dash(-) are allowed max _`30 chars`_  |
| card_number   | Text        | digits only , no whitespace allowed , max _`19 chars`_  |
| expires   | Text        | text in `MM/YY` format ,digits and a slash only `/^\d{2}\/\d{2}$/` , max `5 chars`  |
| cvc   | Text        | either 3 or 4 digits
| remember_card   | checkbox        | not a mandatory field when checked the value will be `remember_card="on"` |

> - Ensure the validation as listed above!
> 
> - Validation errors will be treated as _payment failures_. 
> - Obviously, you can style this form to fit in with the rest of your website.

## Submit the form

When your payer submits this form (don't forget to add a `<button>` or `<input type="submit">`)<br></br>
data will be submitted directly to the gateway system , payment will be processed.

### 3D authentication
> - Your customer might get redirect for authentication against 3D Secure system of his card issuer bank

### Receiving response 
> - After the payment being processed customer will be taken to the `sucess_redirect` or `failure_redirect` depanding on the result 
> also you will notified through the webhook if you subscribed 

:::note
Based on the regulation here in Saudi Arabia most of the transaction required 3D authentication
:::

## PCI compliance 

:::caution
Be aware, though, that while not having to process card data allows you not to comply with the entirety of `PCI DSS SAQ D`<br></br>
requirements, having sensitive cardholder data entry form on your website does raise your `PCI DSS scope to SAQ A-EP`.
