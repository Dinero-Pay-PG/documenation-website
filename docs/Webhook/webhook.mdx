## Overview

The Webhooks API allows you to subscribe to events happening in _payment_ life cycle <br></br>
We will notify in case of an event occured.

## Usage
In order to use the the webhook and receive notification <br></br>
> - You can set it up from the dashboard by going to the _Developer_ section >> _webhooks_
> - Through The API 

## Delivery protocol

When the system send an event to your server , your system should replay with a `status_code= 200` <br></br>
In case if it's not successfully delivered the system will make up to _8_ additional attempts<br></br>
between each attempt the interval will increase <br></br>
no further delivery attempts will be made if the callback is not successfully delivered _36_ hours after triggering.

:::note
Please note that due to the asynchronous nature of network requests, it is possible for a callback delivery confirmation (HTTP response with a 200 series status code) to not properly arrive from the callback's target server. Therefore it is possible in case of severe network faults for the target server to receive a callback, respond to it with a 200 series HTTP status code and then receive the same callback after an interval.
