# Webhook Authentication

Payloads are signed using asymmetric A.K.A. public-key cryptography to guarantee the authenticity of delivered callbacks. <br></br>
Each callback delivery request includes an `X-Signature header` field. This field contains a base64-encoded RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 signature of the SHA256 digest of the request body buffer.  
You can use `sha256WithRSAEncryption` to verify the signature using your `public_key`

## Public key

The public key will be used to verify the `callback` as the only one have access to this public key is you <br></br>

### Obtain the public key

> 1. From the Dashboard >> Developer >> Webhooks
> 2. Calling the endpoint [`GET /public_key`](../../../api/gateway/public-key)

:::tip
You can refer to our ready to go [`libraries`](../ready_to_go/libraries) for a clear sample of the callback authentication
